# Computer Vision Nanodegree Projects
A repository of notebooks and solutions of exercises from the Udacity Computer Vision Nano Degree.

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the **Computer Vision Nanodegree** program, aimed at mastering advanced concepts in computer vision, image processing, deep learning, and AI.

## Overview

Each project is structured to showcase practical applications of computer vision techniques, including object detection, image classification, segmentation, and more, utilizing industry-standard frameworks and libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-Learn.

## Project List

1. **Image Classification**

   - Implemented CNN architectures for image classification tasks.

2. **Object Detection**

   - Built and optimized object detectors using SSD and Faster R-CNN architectures.

3. **Semantic Segmentation**

   - Developed pixel-level segmentation models, leveraging encoder-decoder architectures like U-Net.

4. **Facial Keypoint Detection**

   - Implemented CNN models to detect and localize facial features accurately.

5. **Advanced Computer Vision**

   - Applied transfer learning, fine-tuning advanced pretrained OD/Segmentation models for domain-specific tasks (e.g. autonomous vehicles).
